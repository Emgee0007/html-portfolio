<h1>Anime Recommendation List</h1>
<h2>My Favorite animes</h2> <hr/>

<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
<p>There are a lot of hot guys and I'm a simp TT. I also love the storyline (Although Gege makes me want to commit a crime at times) and the characters (apart from the men).</p>
<h3>Gakuen Babysitters</h3>
<p>I can't help it! It's literally too sweet. Kotaro has my heart and all the babies! My heart!</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>The animation is just chef's kiss, and the back stories! They made me cry a lot.</p>
<h3>My Hero Academia</h3>
<p>It made me feel a lot of strong emotions.</p>
<h3>Dr. Stone</h3>
<p>Science fiction? Count me in. I love Senku, he is the light of my life. I just love him so muchhhhh.</p>
